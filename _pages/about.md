I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo, in Canada.
I am a member of [CrySP](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) and my supervisor is [Prof. Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/).

In my research, I study how to design *privacy enhancing technologies* that offer strong privacy-utility trade-offs.
To do this, I follow a *principled approach rooted in statistical analysis*.
This is a high-level representation of the approach, but it varies from scenario to scenario.

Currently, I apply these techniques to assess the privacy of **searchable encryption** schemes and **machine learning** models.

I received my PhD from the University of Vigo (Spain) under the supervision of [Prof. Carmela Troncoso](http://carmelatroncoso.com/) and [Prof. Fernando Pérez-González ](http://gpsc.uvigo.es/fernando-perez-gonzalez). 
In my thesis, I used statistical analysis techniques to study and design **anonymous communication** systems and **location privacy**-preserving mechanisms.
