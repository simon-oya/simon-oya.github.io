I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo, in Canada.
I am a member of [CrySP](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) and my supervisor is professor [Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/).

My research revolves around privacy enhancing technologies, with special interest in differential privacy and database privacy.

I received my PhD from the University of Vigo (Spain) under the supervision of [Carmela Troncoso](http://carmelatroncoso.com/) and [Fernando Pérez-González ](http://gpsc.uvigo.es/fernando-perez-gonzalez). My thesis focused on the design and study of anonymous communication systems and location privacy-preserving mechanisms.
