I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo, in Canada.
I am a member of [CrySP](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) and my supervisor is [Prof. Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/).

In my research, I use the principles of *statistical inference* to study and design privacy enhancing technologies.
Currently, I apply those techniques to assess the privacy of searchable encryption schemes and machine learning models.


I received my PhD from the University of Vigo (Spain) under the supervision of [Prof. Carmela Troncoso](http://carmelatroncoso.com/) and [Prof. Fernando Pérez-González ](http://gpsc.uvigo.es/fernando-perez-gonzalez). 
In my thesis, I used statistical analysis techniques to study and design anonymous communication systems and location privacy-preserving mechanisms.
