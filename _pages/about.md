I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) department, at The University of British Columbia (UBC).
In my research, I study how to design *privacy-enhancing technologies* that offer strong privacy-utility trade-offs.
<!-- To do this, I follow a *statistical framework*, where the basics steps are to 1) specify the application, users, adversary, and goals; 2) find statistical models for the users' data and behavior; 3) apply statistical analysis tools to solve the problem; 4) validate the theoretical results empirically with real-world data. -->

I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo working with [Prof. Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/) (Oct 2019 – Jul 2023).
I received my PhD from the University of Vigo (Spain) under the supervision of [Prof. Carmela Troncoso](http://carmelatroncoso.com/) and [Prof. Fernando Pérez-González](http://gpsc.uvigo.es/fernando-perez-gonzalez).

<!-- Currently, I apply these techniques to assess the privacy of **searchable encryption** schemes and **machine learning** models. -->

In my thesis, I used statistical analysis techniques to study and design **anonymous communication** systems and **location privacy**-preserving mechanisms. -->

# Research interests
I am broadly interested in computer security and privacy problems.
My research studies these problems from a *statistical perspective*, using theoretical tools to quantify the privacy leakage of different systems and design strong defenses.
My research topics include, but are not limited to:
- Privacy-preserving searchable encryption.
- Privacy-preserving machine learning.
- Anonymous communication systems.
- Differential privacy.

# Prospective students
I am looking for motivated students that want to do research on privacy-enhancing technologies, preferably in the research topics mentioned above.
Please see the [prospective students page](/students) for more information.
