I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) department, at the University of British Columbia (UBC).
In my research, I study how to design *privacy enhancing technologies* that offer strong privacy-utility trade-offs.
To do this, I follow a *statistical framework*, where the basics steps are to 1) specify the application, users, adversary, and goals; 2) find statistical models for the users' data and behavior; 3) apply statistical analysis tools to solve the problem; 4) validate the theoretical results empirically with real-world data.

Currently, I apply these techniques to assess the privacy of **searchable encryption** schemes and **machine learning** models.

I received my PhD from the University of Vigo (Spain) under the supervision of [Prof. Carmela Troncoso](http://carmelatroncoso.com/) and [Prof. Fernando Pérez-González ](http://gpsc.uvigo.es/fernando-perez-gonzalez). 
In my thesis, I used statistical analysis techniques to study and design **anonymous communication** systems and **location privacy**-preserving mechanisms.
