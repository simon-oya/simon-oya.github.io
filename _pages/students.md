# Prospective students
I am looking for motivated students that want to do research with me on various privacy topics.
My main research topics are:
- Privacy-preserving searchable encryption.
- Privacy-preserving machine learning.
- Anonymous communications.
- Differential privacy.

I am open to work on other privacy-related topics as long as there is some common interest.
The privacy problems that I work on usually rely on looking for ways in which an attacker could learn sensitive information about the users of a system.
For this, I rely on mathematical techniques such as Bayesian inference or maximum likelihood estimation, and sometimes leverage machine learning to help with solving optimization problems.
My research has a strong statistical component, so you should be comfortable with probability theory, Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, etc.
You can skim through some of my works on searchable encryption (e.g., perhaps the easiest is this [paper](/files/oya-2021-08-usenix.pdf) [[slides]](/files/oya-2021-08-usenix-slides.pdf)), anonymous communications (e.g, this [paper](/files/oya-2014-07-pets.pdf) [[slides]](/files/oya-2014-07-pets-slides.pdf)), or machine learning (this [paper](/files/oya-2023-07-csf.pdf)).

If you want to apply, please send me an email and include your resume/CV.
Please include the following in your email subject, to show that you have read this website: **"[Prospective Student]"**.
I will not reply to emails that do not include this in the subject.
