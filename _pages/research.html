<p>I am broadly interested in computer security and privacy problems.
My research studies these problems from a <em>statistical perspective</em>, using theoretical tools to quantify the privacy leakage of different systems and design strong defenses.
Click on the following research lines to learn more about them.</p>

    Nowadays, most Internet communications are encrypted, which is great!
    However, even if your <em>data</em> is encrypted, it is not hard for an adversary to tell <em>where</em> your traffic is going (e.g., that particular website you are visiting).
    To hide who talks with whom over the Internet (and other <em>meta-data</em>), we need <strong>anonymous communications systems</strong>.
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is the most successful of such systems, but there are is another type of systems, less known, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network">mixnets</a>.
    Mixnets aim to protect against a global passive adversary, which is something that even Tor cannot do, and despite being quite old conceptually are only recently being deployed.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research in mixnets focuses on understanding and quantifying the privacy guarantees that they provide.
    In the past, I have done this from a theoretical perspective, using statistics and signal processing techniques.
    Recently, we have seen some actual deployments of mixnets (e.g., <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/mixnet">Nym</a>), and I would love to study the privacy of these specific systems!
