<p>I am broadly interested in computer security and privacy problems.
My research studies these problems from a <em>statistical perspective</em>, using theoretical tools to quantify the privacy leakage of different systems and design strong defenses.
Click on the following research lines to learn more about them.</p>

    Nowadays, most Internet communications are encrypted, which is great!
    However, even if your data is encrypted, it is not hard for an adversary to tell <em>where</em> your traffic is going (e.g., that particular website you are visiting).
    To hide who talks to whom over the Internet, as well as other <em>meta-data</em> we need anonymous communications systems.
    [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) is the most successful of such systems, but there are other family, less known, called mixnets.
    Mixnets aim to protect against a global passive adversary, which is something that even Tor cannot do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now I do not have to explain how those works, but you can check some of my papers in the topic if you are interested.
    My research in mixnets focuses on understanding and quantifying the privacy guarantees that they provide.
    In the past, I have done this from a theoretical perspective, using statistics and signal processing techniques.
    Recently, we have seen some actual deployments of mixnets (e.g., [Nym](https://nymtech.net/about/mixnet)), and I would love to study the privacy of these specific systems!
