I am broadly interested in computer security and privacy problems.
My research studies these problems from a *statistical perspective*, using theoretical tools to quantify the privacy leakage of different systems and design strong defenses.
- Privacy-preserving searchable encryption.
- Privacy-preserving machine learning.
- Anonymous communication systems.
- Differential privacy.
